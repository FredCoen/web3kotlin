# Introduction

A Kotlin Multiplatform implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality for iOS and Android.

A simple library which performs JSON-RPC calls over to Ethereum based chains.

I have found that web3.js allows for React mobile apps, but there is not a native solution for iOS and Android.

This library will allow native and Kotlin Multiplatform developers to interact with the Ethereum network over JSON-RPC, for example you could call a method on an eth contract, or fetch the current gas price, all natively!
